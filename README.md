[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickvanw/cbzip2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nickvanw/cbzip2)

package cbzip2 provides access to the "low level" bzip2 interface
via bzlib.h, documented here: a href="http://www.bzip.org/1.0.3/html/low-level.html">http://www.bzip.org/1.0.3/html/low-level.html</a>




## Constants
``` go
const (
    // valid actions
    BZ_RUN    = 0
    BZ_FLUSH  = 1
    BZ_FINISH = 2

    // return codes
    BZ_OK               = 0
    BZ_RUN_OK           = 1
    BZ_FLUSH_OK         = 2
    BZ_FINISH_OK        = 3
    BZ_STREAM_END       = 4
    BZ_SEQUENCE_ERROR   = (-1)
    BZ_PARAM_ERROR      = (-2)
    BZ_MEM_ERROR        = (-3)
    BZ_DATA_ERROR       = (-4)
    BZ_DATA_ERROR_MAGIC = (-5)
    BZ_IO_ERROR         = (-6)
    BZ_UNEXPECTED_EOF   = (-7)

    BZ_CONFIG_ERROR     = (-9)
)
```
copied from bzlib.h


## Variables
``` go
var (
    ErrBadParam       = errors.New("bad param (should be impossible)")
    ErrBadData        = errors.New("integrity problem detected in input data")
    ErrBadMagic       = errors.New("compressed stream does not being with magic bytes")
    ErrMem            = errors.New("insufficient memory available ಠ_ಠ")
    ErrInit           = errors.New("unable to initialize bzlib.h")
    ErrBadCompression = errors.New("unable to compress data")
)
```


## type Reader
``` go
type Reader struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```








### func NewReader
``` go
func NewReader(r io.Reader) (*Reader, error)
```
NewReader returns an io.ReadCloser. Reads from this are read from the
underlying io.Reader and decompressed via bzip2




### func (\*Reader) Close
``` go
func (r *Reader) Close() error
```
Close closes the reader, but not the underlying io.Reader



### func (\*Reader) Read
``` go
func (r *Reader) Read(p []byte) (int, error)
```
Read pulls data up from the underlying io.Reader and decompresses the data



## type Writer
``` go
type Writer struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```








### func NewWriter
``` go
func NewWriter(w io.Writer) (*Writer, error)
```
NewWriter returns an io.WriteCloser. Writes to this writer are
compressed and sent to the underlying writer.
It is the caller's responsibility to call Close on the WriteCloser.
Writes may not be flushed until Close.




### func (\*Writer) Close
``` go
func (b *Writer) Close() error
```
Close closes the writer, flushing any unwritten data to the underlying io.Writer
Close does not close the underlying io.Writer.



### func (\*Writer) Flush
``` go
func (b *Writer) Flush() error
```
Flush writes any pending data to the underlying writer.



### func (\*Writer) Write
``` go
func (b *Writer) Write(d []byte) (int, error)
```
Write writes a compressed p to an underlying io.Writer. The bytes are not
necessarily flushed until the writer is closed or Flush is called.
